Your license to the Instagram APIs under these terms continues until it is terminated by either party. You may terminate the license by discontinuing use of all or any of the Instagram APIs. Instagram may terminate the license at any time for any reason. Your rights to use the Instagram APIs terminate automatically if (i) you violate any of these terms, (ii) Instagram publicly posts a written notice of termination on Instagram.com, (iii) Instagram sends a written notice of termination to you, or (iv) Instagram disables access to the Instagram APIs to you.

	1.	You shall:
	▪	Comply with the Instagram Terms of Use at http://www.instagram.com/legal/terms
	▪	Comply with any requirements or restrictions imposed on usage of the photos by their respective owners. Remember, Instagram doesn't own the images - Instagram users do. Although the Instagram APIs can be used to provide you with access to Instagram user photos, neither Instagram's provision of the Instagram APIs to you nor your use of the Instagram APIs override the photo owners' requirements and restrictions, which may include "all rights reserved" notices (attached to each photo by default when uploaded to Instagram), Creative Commons licenses or other terms and conditions that may be agreed upon between you and the owners. In ALL cases, you are solely responsible for making use of Instagram photos in compliance with the photo owners' requirements or restrictions.
	▪	Comply with any other terms and conditions a user has attached to his or her photo. For example, if a user marks a photo as "private" after using your service, your application must reflect those changes as soon as reasonably possible. If your application has any cached copies of photos that have become "private," you must remove as soon as reasonably possible.
	▪	Remove from your application within 24 hours any Instagram user's photos or other information that the owner of the photo asks you to remove.
	▪	Disclose in your application through a privacy policy or otherwise displayed in the footer of each page, how you collect, use, store, and disclose data collected from visitors, including, where applicable, that third parties (including advertisers) may serve content and/or advertisements and collect information directly from visitors and may place or recognize cookies on visitors' browsers.
	2.	You shall not:
	▪	Use Instagram APIs for any application that replicates or attempts to replace the essential user experience of Instagram.com or the Instagram iPhone App
	▪	Use the Instagram API to spam, or otherwise harass users with unwanted likes, comments or other actions.
	▪	Use the Instagram API to post automated content to Instagram, including likes and comments that were not initiated and entered by an Instagram user.
	▪	Attempt to cloak or conceal your identity or your application's identity when requesting authorization to use Instagram APIs.
	▪	Display more than 30 Instagram photos per page in your application or use an unreasonable amount of bandwidth.
	▪	Cache or store any Instagram user photos other than for reasonable periods in order to provide the service you are providing to Instagram users.
	▪	Use Instagram APIs for any application that constitutes, promotes or is used in connection with spyware, adware, other malicious programs or code.
	▪	Use Instagram APIs in any manner or for any purpose that violates any law or regulation, any right of any person, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of personality.
	▪	Use Instagram as a generic image hosting service for banner advertisements, graphics, etc.
	▪	Use Instagram APIs in a manner that adversely impacts the stability of Instagram.com servers or adversely impacts the behavior of other applications using the Instagram APIs. Further, we reserve the right to rate limit or block applications that make a large number of calls to the API that are not primarily in response to direct user actions.
	▪	Sell, lease, or sublicense Instagram APIs or access thereto or derive revenues from the use or provision of Instagram APIs, whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or otherwise, except as set forth below.

9. Licenses Granted by You
9.1 Videos
LICENSE TO VIMEO: As between you and Vimeo, you own the video content ("videos") that you submit to the Vimeo Service. By submitting a video, you grant Vimeo and its affiliates a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereafter created), and make derivative works from your video for the purpose of (i) displaying the video within the Vimeo Service; (ii) displaying the video on third party websites and applications through a video embed or Vimeo's API subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) allowing other users to play, download, and embed on third party websites the video, subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) promoting the Vimeo Service, provided that you have made the video publicly available; and (iv) archiving or preserving the video for disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations.
LICENSE TO OTHER USERS: You further grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your videos for their personal, non-commercial purposes. This includes the right to copy and make derivative works from the videos solely to the extent necessary to view the videos. The foregoing licenses are in addition to any license you may decide to grant (e.g., a Creative Commons license).
DURATION OF LICENSES: The above licenses will continue unless and until you remove your videos from the Vimeo Service, in which case the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable period of time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely. Please note that removed videos may be cached in search engine indices after removal and that Vimeo has no control over such caching.
9.2 Non-video Content
As between you and Vimeo, you own all non-video content that you submit to the Vimeo Service. You grant Vimeo and its affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereafter created), and make derivative works from your non-video content. In addition, you waive any so-called "moral rights" in your non-video content. You further grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your non-video content for their personal, non-commercial purposes. If you make suggestions to Vimeo on improving or adding new features to the Vimeo Service, Vimeo shall have the right to use your suggestions without any compensation to you.
10. Your Representations and Warranties
For each piece of content that you submit, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have the right to submit the content to Vimeo and grant the licenses set forth above; (ii) Vimeo will not need to obtain licenses from any third party or pay royalties to any third party; (iii) the content does not infringe any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and (iv) the content complies with this Agreement and all applicable laws.
11. Indemnification
You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vimeo and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against all third party actions that: (i) arise from your activities on the Vimeo Service; (ii) assert a violation by you of any term of this Agreement; or (iii) assert that any content you submitted to Vimeo violates any law or infringes any third party right, including any intellectual property or privacy right.
12. Third Party Copyrights and Other Rights
Vimeo respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please send us a notice as set forth in our Copyright and DMCA Policy, which is incorporated into this Agreement. For other intellectual property claims, please send us a notice at legal@vimeo.com.
13. Disclaimers
Vimeo reserves the right to modify the Vimeo Service. You are responsible for providing your own access (e.g., computer, mobile device, Internet connection, etc.) to the Vimeo Service. Vimeo has no obligation to screen or monitor any content and does not guarantee that any content available on the Vimeo Service complies with this Agreement or is suitable for all users.
Vimeo provides the Vimeo Service on an "as is" and "as available" basis. You therefore use the Vimeo Service at your own risk. Vimeo expressly disclaims any and all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any other warranty that might arise under any law. Without limiting the foregoing, Vimeo makes no representations or warranties:
	•	That the Vimeo Service will be permitted in your jurisdiction;
	•	That the Vimeo Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;
	•	Concerning any content submitted by any member;
	•	Concerning any third party's use of content that you submit;
	•	That any content you submit will be made available on the Vimeo Service or will be stored by Vimeo; or
	•	That the Vimeo Service will meet your business or professional needs;
	•	That Vimeo will continue to support any particular feature of the Vimeo Service.
	•	Concerning sites and resources outside of the Vimeo Service, even if linked to from the Vimeo Service.
To the extent any disclaimer or limitation of liability does not apply, all applicable express, implied, and statutory warranties will be limited in duration to a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which you first used the Vimeo Service, and no warranties shall apply after such period.
14. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) Vimeo shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses; and (ii) Vimeo's total liability to you shall not exceed the amounts paid by you to Vimeo over the twelve (12) months preceding your claim(s).
15. Compliance Notice Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2257
All pictures, graphics, videos, and other visual media displayed on the Vimeo Service are exempt from 18 U.S.C. § 2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75 because they do not consist of depictions of conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2256 (2) (A) - (D), but are merely, at most, depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual conduct, or are otherwise exempt because the visual depictions were created prior to July 3, 1995. Vimeo is not the primary producer of the visual content contained in the Vimeo Service.
16. General Provisions
GOVERNING LAW: This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, and the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods shall not apply.

In any such action, Vimeo and you irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury.
INTERPRETATION; SEVERABILITY; WAIVER; REMEDIES: Headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to construe the terms of this Agreement. If any term of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be severed from this Agreement. No failure or delay by Vimeo in exercising any right hereunder will waive any further exercise of that right. Vimeo's rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive.
SUCCESSORS; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES: This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and permitted assigns.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement does not govern any use of Vimeo's application protocol interface (API), which is governed by our API Agreement.
END OF DOCUMENT. Have a nice day.

The document that follows this paragraph is a license agreement.  Why do we need such a thing?  Well, to be perfectly honest, our lawyers have told us that we need to protect ourselves.  We at The Omni Group pride ourselves on our low-key style, but the global nature of the software business means that one lawsuit from one user in a far-flung jurisdiction could put us out of business.  It also means that, without this license agreement, we might not have protection from people who misuse our software.  We do not want to bet our entire company on such possibilities, however unlikely, because we like doing what we do and want to continue to be able to do it.  And, so, we require you to read and agree to this license.  We think you will find it quite reasonable.  Obviously, if you disagree, click "Disagree."  But, don't just stop there.  Let us know.  Send some email to <info@omnigroup.com> telling us what you find unacceptable about our license agreement.  We can't promise to change anything, but we will do our best to get back to you.

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT between you (either an individual or an entity) and Omni Development, Inc. ("The Omni Group").  By clicking on the "Agree" button, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, do not click on the "Agree" button.

1. Grant of Limited License.

The Omni Group grants to you a non-exclusive, limited right to install and use The Omni Group software program downloaded or contained on the CD-ROM or disk (the "Software"). The license permits either (a) multiple users to install and use the Software on a single machine; or (b) a single user to install and use the Software on multiple machines. However, a single license does not allow multiple users to ever use Software on multiple machines, regardless of whether such use is concurrent, except in the case of Family Pack licensing.

Family Pack licenses permit you to install and use the software on up to five computers at a time as long as those computers are located in the same household (portables which are used primarily in this household are included) and used by persons who occupy that same household.  By "household" we mean a person or persons sharing the same housing unit such as a home, apartment, mobile home or condominium. This license does not extend to students who reside at a separate on-campus location or to business or commercial users.

2. Reservation of Rights and Copyright.

The Omni Group reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this License Agreement.  The Software is licensed, not sold.  The Software is owned by The Omni Group, its affiliates or their suppliers and is protected by United States copyright laws and other intellectual property laws and international treaty provisions.  Among other things, copyright laws prohibit you from making derivative works of the Software.  You may, however, make copies of the Software solely for your individual and personal use on multiple computers, provided that you do not copy the Registration Key (see Section 3(a) below) and further provided that you include all copyright and proprietary rights notices on any copies.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not make copies for use on multiple machines if multiple users (including employees, agents, or contractors) will use those machines unless you purchase a corresponding number of seat licenses.

3. Other Restrictions.

(a) If your copy of the Software does not come with a Registration Key, you may register your copy of the Software by purchasing a Registration Key at http://store.omnigroup.com.  The Registration Key will disable a feature of the Software that provides for intermittent reminders that you have not registered your copy of the Software.  You may not copy the Registration Key.  

(b) You may modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.  However, you may not do so for the purpose of disabling the feature of the Software that provides intermittent reminders that you have not registered your copy of the Software (i.e. circumventing the Registration Key system) or for the purpose of circumventing any of the terms of this License Agreement or any other provision of law.

(c) You may not claim that the Software is yours, and you may not use the name The Omni Group or Omni Development to endorse or promote products derived from the Software without prior written permission.

(d) You must use the Software at all times in a manner that is consistent with the software licenses granted to you by other companies that have provided software for your computer.  For example, the Software is designed to be used with the Mac OS X operating system, and so you may not use the Software in a manner inconsistent with the Mac OS X license agreement between you and Apple, Inc.

(e) You may not distribute copies of the Software, in whole or in part, to any third party, nor may you use, rent, loan, sublicense, or lease the Software to third parties.  You further may not use the Software to act as a service bureau or application service provider.

4. Limited Warranty, Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability.

(a) The Omni Group provides a thirty (30) day money-back guarantee on the Software. If you are dissatisfied with the Software for any reason, The Omni Group will refund your money if you return the Software and all copies to the place of purchase within thirty (30) days of the date of the original purchase.  EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING THE SOFTWARE AND ANY DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  THE OMNI GROUP, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR SUPPLIERS FURTHER DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.  THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION REMAINS WITH YOU.  IF THE SOFTWARE PROVES DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT THE OMNI GROUP, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR SUPPLIERS) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING OR REPAIR.  

(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE OMNI GROUP, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR SUPPLIERS OR ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PRODUCTION, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, OR DELIVERY OF ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR FOR OTHER MONETARY LOSS, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE AND OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED TO YOU BY THE OMNI GROUP, OR IN THE PROVISION OF, OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE, SERVICES OR INFORMATION.  This exclusion and limitation shall apply even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. 

Because some states of the United States and some countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of the liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above disclaimer may not apply to you.  Any warranties that by law survive the foregoing disclaimers shall terminate ninety (90) days from the date you downloaded or otherwise received the Software.

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED ABOVE AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF THE OMNI GROUP, ITS AFFILIATES AND ANY OF THEIR SUPPLIERS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT (INCLUDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT), TORT, OR OTHERWISE, AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ALL OF THE FOREGOING, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF DIRECT DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OR U.S.$5.00. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 

5. Fees.

By clicking "Agree," you represent that you have paid The Omni Group any and all applicable license fees for the Software. 

6. Your Warranty to The Omni Group.

You warrant that all individuals having access to the Software will observe and perform all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  You shall, at your own expense, promptly enforce the restrictions in this License Agreement against any person who gains access to your copy of the Software (i.e. the copy you obtain upon agreeing to this License Agreement or any other lawful copy you have made from such copy) with your permission or while your employee and who violates such restrictions, by instituting and diligently pursuing all legal and equitable remedies against him or her.  You agree to immediately notify The Omni Group in writing of any misuse, misappropriation or unauthorized use, disclosure, display or copying of the Software that may come to your attention. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless The Omni Group, its affiliates and their suppliers from any and all claims resulting from or arising out of your use of the Software or breach of this License Agreement.

7. Terms of Service.

If you downloaded the Software, The Omni Group servers will automatically log certain non-personal information from your computer, information such as your IP address.  If you decide you wish to purchase a Registration Key, we require that you provide us with certain billing information that is personal to you ("Personal Information").

Privacy Policy Last Modified: 2012-03-22
Tumblr, Inc. ("Tumblr", "we", "us", or "our") takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the "Privacy Policy") describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the website available at tumblr.com (the "Site") and/or Tumblr's other domains, products, services, and/or content (collectively with the Site, the "Services"). When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.
Also: This Privacy Policy doesn't govern what our users do on their own blogs and we aren't responsible for the information collection and use practices of our individual blogs and bloggers. One of the great features of Tumblr's products is customizability, and bloggers have a lot of flexibility in how their blogs behave. When you visit a blog in our network, that blog may collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third parties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications ("Third Party Services") that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we don't manage or employ. While we try to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.
What Information We Collect and How We Use It
Account Information: When you create an account on a Tumblr Service (an "Account"), you will provide information such as your username, password, and email address. You may also be required to provide us with your birthdate, which we use to verify your age and may use to personalize the Services for you (e.g., by presenting you with content relevant to your age group). This information may personally identify you. For example, if you use your full name as your username, you are disclosing your identity to the public. We also allow users to look for their friends by e-mail address; you can, however, opt out of this feature through your Account Settings page, and we do not expose your e-mail address to the public or third parties, except in the limited circumstances set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Email Communications with Us: As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset). These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. You can opt-out of most communications from Tumblr, such as new follower emails; please see your Account Settings page. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account information; if you receive such an email, forward it to us.
Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you will provide us with your username or other user ID on each of those Third Party Services. You may also be required to engage in an authorization process with each of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token that allows us to access those accounts so that we can, for example, when you choose, post your Tumblr content, or links to your Tumblr content, to those services. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts.
Information Obtained from Third Party Services: In some cases, when you connect your Account with your accounts on Third Party Services, we may obtain information about you from those Third Party Services. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available for Tumblr to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use the information about you that we receive from Third Party Services to improve and personalize the Services. As a general practice, we strongly urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you disclose to Internet services, including Tumblr and linked Third Party Services, regardless of whether you choose to link your accounts together.
User Content: By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. Although we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything you publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through features native to the Services, such as "Reblogging." While you are free to remove published pieces of content from or delete your Account, because of the nature of Internet sharing, the strong possibility of Reblogging of your content by others, and technological limitations inherent to the Services, copies of that content may exist elsewhere and be retained indefinitely, including in our systems.
Information About User Content: In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, when it's included with your images, we may collect information describing your camera and camera settings. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.
Financial Information: We will sometimes collect financial information, such as information related to your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information), for example when you decide to purchase a paid Service. We do not, however, store that financial information; such information is stored by our third party payment processor (the "Payment Processor"), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy (the Payment Processor may also have other terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing yourself with those terms, as applicable). We do receive certain information from our Payment Processor: (1) a unique token that we connect with your Account to enable you to make further purchases using the information stored by our Payment Processor and (2) in certain cases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that token, so that we can prevent fraudulent transactions and identity theft.
Information Related to Use of the Services: We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the Services they have visited, which links on the Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics and Quantcast, to collect and analyze this information. This information enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. Some of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as defined below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your Account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you visit. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not identify you personally. We use information about your use of the Services to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.
Information Related to Your Web Browser: We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is used to enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not, however, used in a manner that would identify you personally.
IP Address Information: Under certain circumstances, such as when you log into the Services, load a web page from the Services, or send an "Ask" message anonymously, we may collect and store your Internet Protocol Address ("IP Address"). We generally use IP Address information to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the Services.
Location Information: In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you.
Information Related to Your Mobile Device: We may collect and store information related to your mobile device, such as your phone number. You will have a choice as to whether we collect and store this information. We may use this information to improve the Services, such as by allowing you to verify your account by text message.
Information Collected Using Cookies: Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on the Services, such as by presenting you with a different iFrame (allowing you to follow a blog) when you are logged in and visit a blog hosted by Tumblr. Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics and Quantcast, may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on our network may contain code that places their own cookies. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
Information About Your Contacts: Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists stored on other services, so that we can connect you with people in our Services that are also on those contact lists. For example, you can temporarily connect your e-mail contact information to your Tumblr.com account, so that we can provide you with a list of your e-mail contacts that use Tumblr.com. As another example, you can send us your mobile phone contact e-mails through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide you with a list of those contacts that use Tumblr.com. We will give you an explicit choice as to whether or not you provide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the appropriate feature, how we use, and whether we will store, that information.
Derived Information: We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of you (for example, what kinds of blogs you like to follow). These characteristics are used to improve and personalize the Services.
Email Tracking: We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that allows us to measure our email deliverability.
With Whom Your Information Is Shared
We never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom; or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.
Information Shared with the Public Through the Services: As noted above, by default, content published through the Services is shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services. Such information includes, but isn't limited to, anything you choose to post on or submit to a public blog, including "About" information that may describe you and anything apparent in a posted photograph. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search), you should be careful in what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it is information you want to share with everyone.
Information Shared Between the Services: We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the Services operate, and to develop new Services.
Information You Share with Third Party Services: You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like blog posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by syndicating posts to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies.
Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services: In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants and other agents ("Agents"), for the purposes of operating and improving the Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
Information Shared with Third Parties: We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-Personal Information with people and entities that we do business with.
Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.
Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request: If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.
The Security of Your Information
Your Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.
We seek to protect your information (including your Account information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
What Information You Can Access
If you are a registered user, you can access and delete most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.
Your California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information that we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 35 East 21st Street, 6th Floor, New York NY 10010.
How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account
If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Preferences page or by emailing us and providing proof of authority over the Account. What constitutes "proof of authority" will vary depending on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting your Account may not fully remove the content you have published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or references to your Account information may not be immediately removed. In addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public activity on your Account prior to deletion (such as Reblogs of your blog posts) may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
Where to Direct Questions or Concerns
If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message.
Link to Prior Versions
You will find a link to prior versions of our Privacy Policy below. We have stored these versions on GitHub, which will also allow you to compare different versions and see what terms have changed:

Refunds will not be granted if ticket purchaser fails to appear for Will Call List entry, or fails to provide photo identification and/or the original credit card used to make the ticket purchase. Ticket purchaser understands and agrees that ticket purchaser's name, city and state of residence, and a portion of ticket purchaser's credit card number will be released to producer and venue in order to ensure ticket purchaser identity.

4. Canceled/Rescheduled Events - Producers or others outside the control of Brown Paper Tickets may cancel or reschedule events. It is at the producer's discretion whether to refund the ticket price or exchange the tickets for a similarly equivalent event should a cancellation or rescheduling occur. Brown Paper Tickets will provide instructions on its website on how to exchange event specific tickets, or obtain ticket price refunds, should an event be cancelled or rescheduled. Service charges and mailing costs will not be refunded in the event of a canceled or rescheduled event. 

5. Pricing, Availability and Seating

a. Event ticket prices are set by the event producer, not Brown Paper Tickets. For most ticket sales in the United States and for events with ticket sales in U.S. Dollars, the Brown Paper Tickets service fee is US$0.99/ticket, plus up to 3.5% of the face value of each event ticket. There may be certain events for which Brown Paper Tickets service fees will be higher, and/or times when a separate venue fee may be added by the event organizer or the venue.

Service fees for ticket sales set in Pounds Sterling are £0.79/ticket plus 3.5% of the face value of each ticket sold. Service fees for ticket sales set in Canadian Dollars are CAD$1.99 plus 3.5% of the face value of each ticket sold.

There may be an additional service fee for event tickets purchased through any Brown Paper Tickets affiliate website.

c. The number of tickets sold for an event is set by the event producer, not Brown Paper Tickets. Brown Paper Tickets will not be held liable for ticket over sales. Should tickets be oversold by the producer, the producer has discretion as to the method of refund, including but not limited to event price refund, or ticket exchange for a similarly equivalent event. Should over sale occur, only whole, non-perforated tickets will be refunded or exchanged.

d. Venue seating charts are provided by producer, and/or the venue, not Brown Paper Tickets. Brown Paper Tickets is not responsible for incorrect seating information, or ticket holder dissatisfaction with selected seating. Any seating dispute is between ticket purchaser and producer and/or venue. Service charges and mailing costs will not be refunded if event tickets are oversold, or if a ticket purchaser is dissatisfied with selected seating.

6. Lost, Stolen, Destroyed Tickets - Lost, stolen, delayed, damaged, or destroyed tickets will not be replaced or refunded, including tickets lost, stolen, delayed, damaged, or destroyed during delivery to ticket purchaser.

7. Refunds and Exchanges - All sales are final. Please review ticket ordering information carefully prior to ticket purchase. Brown Paper Tickets will not refund or exchange tickets, unless event is canceled or rescheduled (see Canceled/Rescheduled Events above).

8. Privacy Policy - There may be events for which the event producer requires the personal information of the ticket purchaser. For other events, the producer will give the option to ticket purchaser at the time of ticket purchase to provide the ticket purchaser name and contact information, including mailing address, email address, and telephone number, to event producer. Once ticket purchaser opts to provide name and contact information to producer, or purchases tickets to which an event producer requires the personal information of the ticket purchaser, Brown Paper Tickets is not responsible for producer's use of such information.

12. Effective Date - These terms, conditions and policies are effective as of December 12, 2010

Gimme More Opening Reception & Panel
GIMME MORE PANEL & COCKTAIL RECEPTION
Moderated by Laetitia Wolff of futureflair, who coordinated the New York edition of this project, the conversation will feature interactive designer Carla Diana, Google designer Jonathan Lee, digital arts scholar Christiane Paul, architect Mike Szivos, Eyebeam director of technology and research Marko Tandefelt and art director Ph. Williams.


ABOUT GIMME MORE
While the mechanics of augmented reality (AR) are surprisingly straightforward, the resulting effects are transporting and revelatory, and also suggest the potential for exciting commercial, design and artistic applications. 

Designed both to inspire and encourage the audience to challenge traditional perceptions and rethink how we generate and use content, "Gimme More" enables exhibition-goers to adopt an experiential role that makes them active participants in the creation of a new media. What all this means for exhibition visitors is the opportunity to gain insight into the meaning of objects, the world around them and even into their own bodies through interactive installations that are by turns fun, ironic and thought-provoking.
